# DDL
**Data definition** or **data description language** (**DDL**) is a syntax for creating and modifying database objects such as tables, indices and users.

DDL statements are similar to a computer programming language for defining data structures, especially database schemas.

It is used to refer to a subset of SQL for declaring tables, columns, data types and constraints.
