# Introduction to Kubernetes
After our application is packaged in a container image somewhere, we need a way to actually run it, and that's where a system like Kubernetes will help us.

kubernetes takes a group of machines and expose them to use as if it was a single thing. 

If we have dozens of replicas of an application running, Kubernetes can load balance the traffic between these replicas.
