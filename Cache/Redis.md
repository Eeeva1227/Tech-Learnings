# Redis

## What is Redis
Redis stands for **REmote DIctionary Server** and was written in C.

It is a NoSQL advanced key-value data store. The read and write operations are very fast in Redis because it stores all data in memory.

The data can also be stored on the **disk** and can be written back to the memory.
